tomography Documentation
========================

Welcome to the document of the tomography. The package is a toolbox for the data collection, processing, analysis
and visualization in the crystal mapping. The crystal mapping is a technique to reveal the spatial or oriental
distribution of single crystals using a series of x-ray diffraction data. There are an old algorithm and a new
algorithm to do this. The package includes both of them. It is recommended to use the new one.
